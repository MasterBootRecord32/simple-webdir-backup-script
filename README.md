# Presentation
The goal of this simple BASH script is to automate the backup of Web virtual hosts on a Web Server using a minimal set of tools. 

# Features
- Backup one or multiple vhosts and compress the files in a 7z archive ;
- Protect the archives with a custom password ;
- Set a custom backup location ;
- Set a custom name for the backups ;
- Send E-Mail at the end of each step ;
- Automatically delete backups older than a custom number of days ;

The code is made so that it is easy to read and understand and can be adapted to specific use-cases.

# Dependencies
- The `cron` job scheduler (optional if you prefer using Systemd timers) ;
- The `p7zip` CLI tool ;
- The `p7zip-plugins` plugins package ;
- A mail transfer agent such as `exim4`, `sendmail`, or `ssmtp` ;

# Installation
1. Clone this repository in your home directory ;
2. Move `web_backup_script.sh` to a dedicated directory (for example, in a .script directory, in your home directory) ;
3. Edit the file to replace the placeholders with the wanted values:

In VARIABLES, replace at:
```
<webdir>, <backupdir>, <recipient_email>, <keep_day>, <webfiles1> and <webfiles2>
```
In BACKUP CREATION & COMPRESSION, replace at:
```
"yourStrongPassword"
```

4. Give the file execution permissions for the owner only and change owner to root:
```
# chmod 700 /path/to/the/.script/web_backup_script.sh && chown root:root /path/to/the/.script/web_backup_script.sh
```

5. Edit `/etc/crontab` and at the end, add:
```
00 0    1 * *   root    sh /path/to/the/.script/web_backup_script.sh
```
This will execute the script on the first of each month at 0:00.

6. If you prefer using a Systemd timer, you will need to create a timer and a service:

Execute ```# systemctl edit --full --force backup-webdir.service``` to create the service unit and add:
```
[Unit]
Description=Run the webdir backup script

[Service]
User=root
ExecStart= /path/to/the/.script/web_backup_script.sh
```
This will execute the web_backup_script.sh from your scripts directory with root privileges.


Then execute ```# systemctl edit --full --force backup-webdir.timer``` to create the timer unit and add:
```
[Unit]
Description=Run a webdir backup one time per month

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-01 00:00:00
Persistent=true
Unit=backup-webdir.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```
This will execute the backup-webdir service on the first of each month at 0:00.

Enable the timer unit using ```# systemctl enable backup-webdir.timer```.

7. To make sure there are no errors in the script, run it using:
```
# sh /path/to/the/.script/web_backup_script.sh
```

8. To make sure there are no errors in the timer and service units:

Start the timer manually:
```
# systemctl start backup-webdir.timer
```
Then check if the task is executed successfully with ```journalctl -xe```.
